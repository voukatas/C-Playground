# C-Playground

Welcome to the C-Playground repository! This is a collection of small, independent projects written in C. Each project is designed to explore different aspects and concepts of the C programming language.

## Projects

1. **HashTable**: A simple thread-safe HashTable implementation where the key is a string and the value can be any type of data. This implementation provides basic operations like set, get, remove, and resize with thread safety using pthread mutexes.
2. **CCache**: A simple single-threaded event-driven program that wannabe a TTL cache
